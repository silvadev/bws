======================

About
-----

**BWS** is a **dart-based** web server that provides static files for  
developers to test your websites locally without the weight of Apache.

How to use
----------

**FIRST** Install the **DartVM** via [DartSDK](https://www.dartlang.org/tools/sdk/#getting-the-sdk).   

**SECOND** After the install, go to the folder you have downloaded  
the **BWS**, via terminal, and then runs once `pub get`, to download all  
libs the server needs.

**THIRD** Create a folder in the root of bws project called 'web/'  
and put your web files inside.

**FOURTH** After all the modifications you have done in the files  
in the **web/** folder, run the comand `pub build` at the **BWS** root  
folder and run the server via `dart bin/bws.dart`

**FIFTH** ENJOY!

Future
------

The Venosyd Open Source Team **(THE VOST)** will extend the server to more  
complex and delicious funcionalities.
